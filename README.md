## Use Case

Imagine youâ€™re at home or in an office:

* You can quickly share files like photos, documents, or videos between your phone and computer without using cloud services (e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox).
* Any device on the same Wi-Fi network can interact with the Local Box to upload files or retrieve hosted files.

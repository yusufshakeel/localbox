## Use Case

Imagine youâ€™re at home or in an office:

* You can quickly share files like photos, documents, or videos between your phone and computer without using cloud services (e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox).
* Any device on the same Wi-Fi network can interact with the Local Box to upload files or retrieve hosted files.

## Server Clients

The computer that is running this application will act like the server. A local IP address (like 192.168.0.151)
will be displayed. Clients (other users) can connect to that IP address via browsers.

Make sure to add port number to the url.

If the server IP is 192.168.0.151 and is running at port 3001 then type `http://192.168.0.151:3001` in the browser.

## Minimum requirements

Software:
* Node.js (version 16 or higher)
* npm
* npx

Hardware:
* Any modern/older laptop or desktop should work.
  * I am using HP ProBook 6450b laptop from the year 2010.
  * Specs:
    * 320GB HDD
    * 4GB RAM
    * Ubuntu 20.04LTS.

This will build the application.

```

Alternatively, run the following command if you want to run the application in dev mode.

* You will see the url of the localbox application in the terminal after it starts running.

* Open the url (example [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) in the browser.

## First time setup

* Go to Home page, and you will see localbox perform some setup operations.
* You will also get the **admin** account created.
* A `setup.lock` file will be created inside the `/private` folder.

Default credentials

Password: root1234
```
Change the password of the **admin** account after logging in.

## Rerun setup

* Delete the `setup.lock` file from the `/private` folder.
* Run the server `npm run start` or `npm run dev`
* Open the Home page.
